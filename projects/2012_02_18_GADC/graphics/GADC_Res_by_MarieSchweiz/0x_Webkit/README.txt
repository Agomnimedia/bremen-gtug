Dear GTUG Managers and event organizers, 

The files in this package should help you to promote your event professionally.
In addition to the ready-to-use "map droid" we provide you with a blank version (both with PSD source file) to adjust the droid according to your needs.

Of course you don't have to use them but as we in Berlin,Germany have been provided with these files and have been given the opportunity to share it we want to give you the possiblity to make use of these great visuals.
